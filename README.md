# Sandbox

If you are new to git, this is a place to play.

Files are displayed by clicking on the file name in the file list above.

Files can be edited online by clicking the `edit` button in the toolbar on the top of the file pane.

Changes are saved by clicking the commit button on the bottom of the edit page.

## Writing Text

Files with the file name extension `.md` are shown as formated text files in GitHub. 
Text is formated using special annotations (markup) in the text. A short introduction can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/). You may also just edit this 
file to see and try how it works. It's really simple and intuitive.

Here are some examples:

#### Headings

Headings start with `#`. Toplevel headings with a single `#`, second level with `##`, third level with `###`, and so on.

Here is an example:

```.md
## This is a second level Heading
```

#### Lists:

Writing 

```.md
*    an item
*    another item
     *    an item in a sub-list
     *    and another item in a sub-list
```

is show as:

*   an item
*   another item
    *   an item in a sub-list
    *   and another item in a sub-list

An enumeration is created similarly:

```.md
1.  First item
2.  and second item
```

is show as

1.  First item
2.  and second item

#### Italic and Bold Text

```.md
This *word* is italic and this **word** is bold.
```

is show as

This *word* is italic and this **word** is bold.

Hello world
